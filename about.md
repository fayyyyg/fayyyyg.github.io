### Bio

Yifei Gao is an acclaimed painter and mixed media artist, hailing from Hunan Changsha, China before settling in California. Currently enrolled in the prestigious Bachelor of Fine Arts program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), she has been awarded the Merit Scholarship.

Gao's distinctive style fuses a meticulous focus on technical artistry with an emotional detachment that reflects her profound interest in the artificial and unnatural.

### Artist Statement

Yifei Gao's artistic oeuvre primarily consists of 2D images crafted using mixed materials, including oil on canvas and watercolor. Color is integral to her art, serving not only as an aesthetic element but also as a potent vehicle for expression, deeply shaped by cultural context. She is captivated by the emotional power color wields and how subtle variations in shade or hue can evoke profound responses rooted in individual and collective experiences.

Beyond the beauty lies a pervasive sense of emptiness within her work. This tension between visual allure and the void beneath reflects an exploration into nihilism – the concept that everything is transient and fleeting. The vibrant colors, while captivating, are ultimately a veneer concealing emotions that may dissolve into nothingness. In her art, Gao endeavors to reconcile the allure of visual beauty with an acknowledgment of its inherent ephemerality. Beauty can be compelling, but it can also be empty. This paradox is at the heart of her creative process and defines the core of her artistic expression.
