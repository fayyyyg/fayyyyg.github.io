### Artist Statement

【I am a visual artist. My practice involves various materials, mainly painting, fabric, AI, art and tech, and video. I like creating images that evoke a sense of strangeness. Images are the cornerstone of my creation. I prefer artificial, synthetic, and technological elements. My work is perfect for hanging in the mansions of the rich. It’s highly decorative, not very critical, and not very deep, you don’t need to have read a lot of books to understand it🫶🏻🫶🏻. My paintings are a pure form of charity. They don’t need you to understand my pain or exhaust your empathy, just look at them and enjoy the beauty. I offer beauty to the world. Because I’m just that kind of kind person. If you like my work, no need to thank me, just give me money and you can take it home to decorate your living room. ❤️‍🔥

Sorry, I’m joking. What I really mean is:

Here’s my logic. I’m a visual artist. I’m reality-oriented and result-driven. I think there are only two legitimate functions of painting:
1.To help the artist release emotions. what professionals call “splitting-based compensation.” 2.Decoration.

I don’t believe in the idea that “art should be critical” or “art should change the world”at least not when it comes to visual artists. From a result-oriented point of view, if someone’s goal is to change the world, becoming a visual artist is probably the least efficient way to do that.

First of all, images are inefficient at transmitting information. They may cause emotional disturbance, but they cannot effectively convey actionable instructions or value paths. A lot of people end up having to use language to explain their images anyway, which is literally like taking your pants off to fart. Might as well just speak directly. Using images just adds unnecessary cost to communication.

Second, the art world is a closed system. Artists don’t even fully understand each other let alone reach the outside world.

And this world doesn’t suffer from “not knowing the problem.” The issues artists usually critique have already been thoroughly critiqued by philosophers long ago. It’s not that people don’t know; it’s that they know and still don’t change. Critique is just repeating worn-out nonsense.

So in the end, I believe visual artists don’t really have that much social function. We should accept our place and stop fantasizing about influence we don’t actually have.】

我是个视觉艺术家，我的练习涉及各种材料，主要是绘画，布料，AI, Art and tech，视频。 我喜欢制作陌生感的图像，图像是我创作的基石，我偏爱人造，合成，科技的元素。我的作品很适合挂在富人的豪宅。因为装饰性很强也不怎么批判也没什么深度不需要富人读很多书才能理解🫶🏻🫶🏻。我的画是一种纯粹的慈善，它不需要你理解我的痛苦消耗你的共情，只需要看着我的画面享受美丽。我把美丽献给世界。因为我就是一个这么善良的人，如果你喜欢我的画，不用谢，给我钱就好了。你就可以把它带回去装饰客厅❤️‍🔥

对不起我开玩笑的 我想说的其实是

我的逻辑是这样的。我是个视觉艺术家。我偏现实逻辑结果导向。我觉得画只有两个真正说得通的功能。一. 帮助艺术家自己疏解情绪。专业精神术语是分裂式代偿。二. 装饰。

我不相信“艺术应该批判、应该改变世界”的说法，至少不适用于视觉艺术家。从结果导向来说，如果目的是改变世界，那成为视觉艺术家简直是效率最低的路径：

首先图像传达信息的效率太低。图像可以引发感受上的扰动，但它无法有效地传递行动上的指令或价值路径。很多人最后还要用语言来解释自己的画，这简直就是脱裤子放屁。不如直接说话。用图像来表达简直就是无端增加沟通的成本。

其次艺术圈是个封闭系统，艺术家彼此都没互相听懂，更别说传达给外界了。

而且这世界不是“不知道问题”，艺术家通常批判的那些哲学家早就批判过了。而是“知道了也不改”，批判只是重复说烂的废话。

所以最后，我认为，视觉艺术家的社会功能并不高。我们就该认清自己的位置，不要幻想自己有自己实际上没有的影响力。
