### Bio

Yifei Gao is an acclaimed painter and mixed media artist, hailing from Hunan Changsha, China before moving to California. Currently enrolled in the prestigious Bachelor of Fine Arts program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), she has been awarded the Merit Scholarship. Her artwork has been exhibited in renowned galleries such as Artbash, SAIC, 2024, and Valley Gallery, Chicago, 2024. Gao's distinctive style fuses a meticulous focus on technical artistry with an emotional detachment that reflects her profound interest in the artificial and unnatural.

### Artist Statement

Yifei Gao's artistic practice is rooted in mixed media on canvas, where she delves into the interplay between chaos and order, drama, and abstraction. Her work draws inspiration from techno music, a medium of rhythm and unpredictability that resonates with her fascination for creation, particularly in the realm of fashion. Gao finds beauty in the unnatural, favoring artificial and synthetic elements that evoke a sense of technological aesthetics and the sleek allure of electronic devices.
Her pursuit lies in crafting images that have never been seen before—visions that are not only original but deeply connected to the era she inhabits and the environment that surrounds her. Gao seeks to build a visual "big picture," a world within her work that encapsulates everything—every fragment of disorder, every chaotic detail—transformed into a cohesive artistic expression. Her creations aspire to transcend boundaries, presenting a comprehensive universe where the seemingly disparate elements of life converge into a harmonious and dynamic whole.
