### Bio

【Yifei Gao (b.China) is a mixed-media artist based in Chicago. She works across painting, textile, and digital processes to build surfaces that oscillate between image and object. Her practice is rooted in material experimentation and a form of non-linguistic thinking — a way of processing through making rather than language.
  Gao’s work draws from fashion and architectural aesthetics, using fabric, printing, airbrush, and reflective materials to construct densely layered images that explore beauty, artificiality, and control. Her recent projects investigate how surface and structure can construct beauty and control, focusing on the tension between visual excess and emotional restraint.
  She is currently pursuing a BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she received the Merit Scholarship. Her work has been shown at Artbash (SAIC, 2024) and Valley Gallery (Chicago, 2024).】

高逸菲（生于中国）是一位驻芝加哥的混合媒体艺术家。她跨越绘画、纺织与数字工艺，构建出游走于图像与实体之间的表面。其创作植根于材料实验与非语言思维——通过制作而非语言进行思维处理的方式。高逸菲的作品汲取时尚与建筑美学养分，运用织物、印刷、喷枪及反光材料构建多层图像，探索美感、人工痕迹与控制力。近期项目聚焦表面与结构如何建构美感与控制，着重呈现视觉过剩与情感克制的张力关系。她目前就读于芝加哥艺术学院（SAIC）并获得优异奖学金攻读美术学士学位。其作品曾于Artbash（SAIC，2024）及Valley Gallery（芝加哥，2024）展出。
