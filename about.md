### Artist Statement

【Yifei Gao's artistic practice is rooted in mixed media on canvas, where she delves into the interplay between chaos and order, drama, and abstraction. Her work draws inspiration from techno music, a medium of rhythm and unpredictability that resonates with her fascination for creation, particularly in the realm of fashion. Gao finds beauty in the unnatural, favoring artificial and synthetic elements that evoke a sense of technological aesthetics and the sleek allure of electronic devices.
Her pursuit lies in crafting images that have never been seen before—visions that are not only original but deeply connected to the era she inhabits and the environment that surrounds her. Gao seeks to build a visual "big picture," a world within her work that encapsulates everything—every fragment of disorder, every chaotic detail—transformed into a cohesive artistic expression. Her creations aspire to transcend boundaries, presenting a comprehensive universe where the seemingly disparate elements of life converge into a harmonious and dynamic whole.】

高逸菲的艺术实践根植于画布上的混合媒介，她在其中深入研究混乱与秩序、戏剧和抽象之间的相互作用。她的作品灵感来自电子音乐，这是一种节奏感和不可预测性的媒介，与她对创造的迷恋产生了共鸣，尤其是在时尚领域。高逸菲在非自然中发现美，偏爱人造和合成元素，这些元素唤起了技术美感和电子设备的时尚魅力。她的追求在于制作从未见过的图像——这些视觉效果不仅独创，而且与她所处的时代和她周围的环境息息相关。高逸菲寻求构建一个视觉“大图景”，一个在她的作品中囊括一切的世界——每一个无序的碎片，每一个混乱的细节——都转化为一个有凝聚力的艺术表达。她的作品渴望超越界限，呈现一个全面的宇宙，看似分散的生命元素汇聚成一个和谐而充满活力的整体。
